 function p = prox_log(x, gamma)
%function p = prox_log(x, gamma)
%
% The function computes the proximity operator of the function:
%
%                     f(y) = -gamma * log(x)
%
% When the input 'x' is an array, the output 'p' is computed element-wise.
%
%  INPUTS
% ========
%  x     - ND array
%  gamma - positive, scalar or ND array with the same size as 'x'
